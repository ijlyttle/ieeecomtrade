Here is where I start to argue with myself on the API.

We could be provided a zip file.

We could be provided a header file.

We could be provided a data file.

We use the header file to make a list of metadata. Some of this metadata is useful only to read the data, other metadata is useful to understand the context of the waveform.

We could have a functions to read the header file, data file, and zip file.

```r
ctread_header(file)
ctread_data(file)
ctread_zip(file)
```

Like **readr**, `file` could be a path to a file, a connection, or literal data (either a single string or a raw vector).
