Description: The IEEE provides the COMTRADE standard as a file-format 
  to record transient power-system disturbances. The purpose of this 
  package is to allow you to import COMTRADE files into R. The first focus
  is on header files and data files that conform to the 1999 standard, and to 
  return a list and a data frame. Future work may incorporate the other files 
  and the 2013 standard.
